# CSP_MapColoring *c
The program will color a map rapresented a graph  with nodes and intersections
Time complex. {(n^2)*c} where 1 <= c <= 3
def compile_colors(graph, colors):
    for node in graph
        node.color = first color 
        while collision in node with other colors:
            change color
            if all color have been tried: 
                this graph can't be solved
                return
